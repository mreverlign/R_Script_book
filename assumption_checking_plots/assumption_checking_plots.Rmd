# --- 2. Sample Data ---
data("iris")

# --- 3. Checking for Normality ---
# A visual test for whether the data follows a normal distribution.

# A. Q-Q Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot)
# `qqnorm` plots sample quantiles against theoretical normal quantiles.
# If data is normal, points fall along the line drawn by `qqline`.
qqnorm(iris$Sepal.Length, main = "Normal Q-Q Plot for Sepal Length")
qqline(iris$Sepal.Length, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# B. Shapiro-Wilk Test (Quantitative Test)
# H0: The data is normally distributed.
# A p-value > 0.05 suggests the data is not significantly different from normal.
shapiro.test(iris$Sepal.Length)


# --- 4. Checking for Homogeneity of Variance ---
# This assumption (homoscedasticity) means the variance is equal across groups.
# Crucial for ANOVA.

# A. Visual Check with Box Plots
# Look for similar box heights (IQRs) across the groups.

# B. Levene's Test (Quantitative Test)
# H0: The variances are equal across all groups.
# A p-value > 0.05 suggests the variances are not significantly different.
# `leveneTest()` performs an ANOVA on the absolute deviations from the median.
