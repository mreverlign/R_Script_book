# --- 1. Sample Data ---
# The 'sleep' dataset shows the effect of two soporific drugs on 10 patients.
# It is structured for both paired and independent tests.
data("sleep")
head(sleep)

# --- 2. Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (Mann-Whitney U Test) ---
# Use this to compare two INDEPENDENT groups.
# H0: The distributions of the two groups are the same.
group1 <- sleep$extra[sleep$group == 1]
group2 <- sleep$extra[sleep$group == 2]

wilcox.test(group1, group2)


# --- 3. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test ---
# Use this to compare two PAIRED groups.
# Here, we can treat the 'extra' sleep as a paired observation per patient,
# even though they were given different drugs.
# Let's create a more canonical paired dataset for clarity.

# Sample data: weight of subjects before and after a program
weight_before <- c(88, 92, 75, 81, 95, 99, 78, 85)
weight_after <- c(85, 89, 73, 79, 91, 94, 77, 83)

# H0: There is no difference in the ranks of paired differences.
# The `wilcox.test` function uses C routines to rank data and compute the statistic.
wilcox.test(weight_before, weight_after, paired = TRUE)
