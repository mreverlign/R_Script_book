# --- 2. Sample Data ---
# The 'kyphosis' dataset from rpart is a good example for classification.
# It contains data on children who have had corrective spinal surgery.
# Goal: Predict if Kyphosis (a post-operative deformity) is present.
data("kyphosis", package = "rpart")
head(kyphosis)

# --- 3. Build the Decision Tree Model ---
# Formula: `Kyphosis ~ .` means "predict Kyphosis using all other variables".
# The `rpart()` C code recursively evaluates splits to minimize impurity.
tree_model <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start,
                    data = kyphosis,
                    method = "class") # Specify a classification tree

# --- 4. Visualize the Decision Tree ---
# `rpart.plot` creates a highly readable plot of the decision rules.
rpart.plot(tree_model,
           type = 2,           # Use labels on branches
           extra = 104,        # Show prob & percentage of obs in nodes
           fallen.leaves = TRUE, # Put leaves at the bottom
