# --- 1. Sample Data ---
# The 'InsectSprays' dataset has counts of insects after being treated with
# different sprays. This is a classic example for this test.
data("InsectSprays")
head(InsectSprays)

# --- 2. Visualize the Data ---
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(InsectSprays, aes(x = spray, y = count, fill = spray)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Insect Counts by Spray Type",
       x = "Spray", y = "Insect Count") +
  theme_minimal()

# --- 3. Perform the Kruskal-Wallis Test ---
# H0: The distribution of insect counts is the same across all spray types.
# The test computes ranks across all observations and then sums them per group.
kruskal_result <- kruskal.test(count ~ spray, data = InsectSprays)
print(kruskal_result)

# --- 4. Post-Hoc Test ---
# If the Kruskal-Wallis test is significant, a post-hoc test is needed to
# find out which specific groups are different from each other.
# The Dunn's test is a common choice.
# install.packages("dunn.test")
library(dunn.test)
dunn.test(InsectSprays$count, InsectSprays$spray, method = "bonferroni")
