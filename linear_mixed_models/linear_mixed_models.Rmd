# --- 2. Sample Data ---
# The 'sleepstudy' dataset from lme4 is a classic example of repeated measures.
# It tracks reaction times of subjects over 10 days of sleep deprivation.
# - Reaction: Dependent variable (reaction time).
# - Days: Fixed effect (time predictor).
# - Subject: Random effect (grouping factor).
data("sleepstudy", package = "lme4")

# --- 3. Visualize the Data ---
# Show individual trajectories and the overall trend.
ggplot(sleepstudy, aes(x = Days, y = Reaction, group = Subject)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) + # Individual subject lines
  geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") + # Overall trend
  labs(title = "Reaction Time Over Days of Sleep Deprivation",
       subtitle = "Each line is a different subject")

# --- 4. Fit the Linear Mixed-Effects Model ---
# Model: Reaction ~ Days + (1 | Subject)
# - Fixed Effect: `Days`. We model an overall population slope for Days.
# - Random Effect: `(1 | Subject)`. This is a "random intercept". It allows
#   each subject to have their own baseline reaction time, accounting for
#   the fact that measurements from the same subject are correlated.
# `lmer` uses C++ (Eigen library) for fast estimation.
lmm_model <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 | Subject), data = sleepstudy)


# --- 5. Interpret the Model Results ---
# The summary provides estimates for fixed effects and variances for random effects.
