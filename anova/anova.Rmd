# --- 2. One-Way ANOVA ---
# Tests the effect of ONE categorical independent variable on a continuous
# dependent variable.

# Sample Data
data("chickwts")

# Visualize
ggplot(chickwts, aes(x = feed, y = weight, fill = feed)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Chick Weight by Feed Type")

# Perform One-Way ANOVA
# `aov()` fits a linear model using QR decomposition.
anova_one_way <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
summary(anova_one_way)

# Post-Hoc Test (if ANOVA is significant)
# Tukey's HSD (Honest Significant Differences) finds which pairs of groups differ.
TukeyHSD(anova_one_way)


# --- 3. Two-Way ANOVA ---
# Tests the effects of TWO categorical independent variables and their
# interaction on a continuous dependent variable.

# Sample Data
data("ToothGrowth")
head(ToothGrowth)

# Visualize with interaction plot
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = factor(dose), y = len, color = supp, group = supp)) +

# Perform Two-Way ANOVA
# The `*` symbol tests for both main effects (supp, dose) and the interaction (supp:dose).
