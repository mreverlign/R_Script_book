# --- 2. Sample Data ---
# The 'diamonds' dataset from ggplot2 is great for showing group differences.

# --- 3. Box Plots for Group Comparison ---
# Box plots provide a succinct summary of distributions across groups .
# They show median, quartiles, whiskers, and outliers.

# --- 4. Raincloud Plots for Richer Insight ---
# Raincloud plots combine a density plot, box plot, and raw data points.
# They offer a more complete picture of the data distribution.

  # Add the individual data points (the 'rain')
  # Use gghalves for better alignment
